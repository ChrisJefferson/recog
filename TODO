Tomorrow:

  - decide whether new classical natural method is possible
  - balanced trees
  - some tuning
  - revisit challenges
  - early sporadics methods?
  - generic sporadics hint
  - verification/presentations

Local TODO list:

  - Look at Product Replacers again (--> orb): no need for accus during mixing
  - Use RECOG.RandomSubProduct everywhere
  - Look at all PseudoRandoms (still TODO)
  - Move D247 before FindEvenNormal to speed up things
  - implement classical natural for odd case (--> LG OB)
  - genss: Make call to StabilizerChain which is guaranteed to be quick
    possible
  - more reps for specific hint (-> covers and non-atlasrep reps)
  - think about BrauerCharacterValue method
  - general tuning
  - revisit examples/challenges
  - implement sl2 natural
  - fix new FindElmOf method with respect to PseudoRandom
  - balanced trees?
  - a_n in deleted perm rep
  - adjoint rep of sl_n
  - nonconstructive Lie type

Before release:

 - create Makefile
 - do not ship contrib
 - do not ship named subdirs in gap

Do soonish:

  - Look at random sources in recog?
Investigate bug in DisplayCompositionFactors for ex9 in talk
Put Eamonn and Gunter as authors
Investigate MatC6 errors
Print error found and where!
example12 no longer seems to work, why?
Cleanup tensor.gd  (still needed) and tensor.gi
Cleanup matrix.gi (e.g. remove det code)
Native quick genss method?


Soonest:

 - Pete Sp -> send mail
 - PCGS with memory: Luks, Murray, Cooperman implementation
 - Hash functions for vectors over finite fields 257 <= q <= 65536 
   -> NumberFFVector
 - GenSS: Handle "small" cases quick
 - Quick stabchain access for small cases
 - ?At the same time use found normal subgroup to find action if possible
 - Finish derived case for only one homogeneous component (-> tensor)
 - Finish semilinear by looking for field automorphisms in derived
 - Make NaturalSL a projective method -> polish l(2,q), use bb-l(2,q)
 - Make TwoLargeElOrds a projective method, polish databases setup
 - Implement constructive classical in natural rep ->O'Brien/Leedham-Green
 - TwoElementOrds: Ignore degree bound if in defining characteristic

Sooner:
 - Get ActionHomomorphism behaviour fixed -> gap-dev
 - more Tests for tensor decomposable
 - O'Brien/Malle recognition?
 - SGS Matrix verification

Soon:
 - MinBlocks from Steve?
 - Lowindex using derived subgroup?
 - Do something if LowIndex stumbles on non-Absolute irreducible restriction
 - Find Tiep's paper with exception lists
 - Change message to something about "defining characteristic".
 - add Steve's Simple recognition
 - do more C9 cases by collecting hints
 - do more C9 cases
 - do more C9 cases


Talk with Akos:

 - new stuff with two largest element orders
 - separate?
 - bug in BB alternating
 - do we want to do BB alternating???
 - bug in C6 ruining challenge5

========================================================================

Future: 

Cleanup and complete the code for using blackbox and gensift

Do we have something better for diagonal matrices???

make New...StraightLineProgram official, throw old stuff out
slp code into main library

improvements of library in library

 - Replace PseudoRandom with product replacer objects  --> eigenes

========================================================================

to change once the new vector/matrix interface is in place:

  FieldOfMatrixGroup/DefaultFieldOfMatrixGroup
