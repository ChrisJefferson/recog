Do soonish:

ProjDet: more than one nice gen???
Add Frank Celler, Mark Stather as authors
See how Akos' students are handled in this way...
Cleanup tensor.gd  (still needed) and tensor.gi
Cleanup matrix.gi (e.g. remove det code)


Soonest:

 - Pete Sp -> send mail
 - PCGS with memory: Luks, Murray, Cooperman implementation
 - Hash functions for vectors over finite fields 257 <= q <= 65536 
   -> NumberFFVector
 - GenSS: Handle "small" cases quick
 - Quick stabchain access for small cases
 - ?At the same time use found normal subgroup to find action if possible
 - Finish derived case for only one homogeneous component (-> tensor)
 - Finish semilinear by looking for field automorphisms in derived
 - Make NaturalSL a projective method -> polish l(2,q), use bb-l(2,q)
 - Make TwoLargeElOrds a projective method, polish databases setup
 - Implement constructive classical in natural rep ->O'Brien/Leedham-Green
 - TwoElementOrds: Ignore degree bound if in defining characteristic

Sooner:
 - Get ActionHomomorphism behaviour fixed -> gap-dev
 - more Tests for tensor decomposable
 - O'Brien/Malle recognition?
 - SGS Matrix verification

Soon:
 - Involution centralizer method?
 - Play with tensor induced
 - MinBlocks from Steve?
 - Lowindex using derived subgroup?
 - Do something if LowIndex stumbles on non-Absolute irreducible restriction
 - Find Tiep's paper with exception lists
 - Change message to something about "defining characteristic".
 - add Steve's Simple recognition
 - do more C9 cases by collecting hints
 - do more C9 cases
 - do more C9 cases

========================================================================

Future: 

Cleanup and complete the code for using blackbox and gensift

Do we have something better for diagonal matrices???

make New...StraightLineProgram official, throw old stuff out
slp code into main library

improvements of library in library

 - Replace PseudoRandom with product replacer objects  --> eigenes

========================================================================

to change once the new vector/matrix interface is in place:

  FieldOfMatrixGroup/DefaultFieldOfMatrixGroup
