  This chapter explains, what one can do with recognition info records after a
  successfull recognition (and possibly verification).
  
  Of  course,  one can inspect the whole tree of recognition info records just
  by looking at the stored attribute values. Moreover, constructive membership
  tests  can  be  performed using the function [1m[34mSLPforElement[0m ([1m4.2-15[0m), thereby
  writing  an  arbitrary  element  in  terms of the nice generators, which are
  stored  in  the  attribute  [1m[34mnicegens[0m  ([1m4.2-8[0m). If [22m[32mfail[0m is returned, then the
  element  in question does not lie in the recognised group or the recognition
  made an error.
  
  
  [1m[4m[31m5.1 Functions and methods for recognition info records[0m
  
  If  you  need  an  element  explicitly  written  in  terms  of  the original
  generators, you can use the following function:
  
  [1m[4m[31m5.1-1 SLPforNiceGens[0m
  
  [1m[34m> SLPforNiceGens( [0m[22m[34mri[0m[1m[34m ) _____________________________________________[0mfunction
  [1mReturns:[0m  an SLP expressing the nice generators in the original ones
  
  This  function  assembles  a  possibly  quite  large  straight  line program
  expressing  the  nice  generators in terms of the original ones by using the
  locally stored information in the recognition tree recursively.
  
  You  can  concatenate straight line programs in the nice generators with the
  result  of  this  function  to  explicitly  write an element in terms of the
  original generators.
  
  [1m[4m[31m5.1-2 Size[0m
  
  [1m[34m> Size( [0m[22m[34mri[0m[1m[34m ) _________________________________________________________[0mmethod
  [1mReturns:[0m  the size of the recognised group
  
  This  method  calculates the size of the recognised group by multiplying the
  size of the factor and the kernel recursively. It is assumed that leaf nodes
  know already or can calculate the size of their group.
  
  [1m[4m[31m5.1-3 DisplayCompositionFactors[0m
  
  [1m[34m> DisplayCompositionFactors( [0m[22m[34mri[0m[1m[34m ) __________________________________[0mfunction
  [1mReturns:[0m  nothing
  
  This   function  displays  a  composition  series  by  using  the  recursive
  recognition  tree.  It  only works, if the usual operation [1m[34mCompositionSeries[0m
  ([1mReference: CompositionSeries[0m) works for all leaves.
