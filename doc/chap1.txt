  [1m[4m[31m1.2 Overview over this manual[0m
  
  Chapter  [1m2.[0m describes the installation of this package. Chapter [1m4.[0m describes
  the  generic, recursive procedure used for group recognition throughout this
  package.   At   the   heart   of   this   procedure  is  the  definition  of
  "FindHomomorphism" methods, which is also described in that chapter. For the
  choice of the right method for finding a homomorphism (or an isomorphism) we
  use  another  generic  procedure,  the "method selection" which is not to be
  confused  with  the  [1mGAP[0m  method  selection.  Our  own  method  selection is
  described  in  detail  in  Chapter  [1m3.[0m, because it is interesting in its own
  right and might be useful in other circumstances.
