<Heading>Installation of the <Package>recogbase</Package>-Package</Heading>
<Index><Package>recogbase</Package></Index>

To install this  package just extract the package's  archive file to
the  GAP  <F>pkg</F>  directory.<P/>

By default the <Package>recogbase</Package> package is not automatically
loaded by &GAP; when it is installed. You must load the package with
<C>LoadPackage("recogbase");</C> before its functions become available.<P/>

Usually, this package is only usable if you also install the
<Package>recog</Package> containing all the implemented recognition
methods. Since the <Package>recog</Package> then automatically loads
the <Package>recogbase</Package> the only has to load both packages
with <C>LoadPackage("recog");</C>.<P/>

Please, send us an e-mail if you have any questions, remarks,
suggestions, etc. concerning this package. Also, I would like to hear
about applications of this package.<P/>
