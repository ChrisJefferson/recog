This package is about group recognition. To be written further.

Chapter <Ref Chap="install"/> describes the installation of this package.
Chapter <Ref Chap="recognition"/> describes the generic, recursive procedure
used for group recognition throughout this package. At the heart of this
procedure is the definition of <Q>FindHomomorphism</Q> methods, which is
also described in that chapter. For the choice of the right method
for finding a homomorphism (or an isomorphism) we use another generic
procedure, the <Q>method selection</Q> which is not to be confused with
the &GAP; method selection. Our own method selection is described in detail
in Chapter <Ref Chap="methsel"/>, because it is interesting in its own 
right and might be useful in other circumstances.<P/>
