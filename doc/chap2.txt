  
  [1m[4m[31m2. Installation of the [1mrecogbase[1m[4m[31m-Package[0m
  
  To  install  this package just extract the package's archive file to the GAP
  [1mpkg[0m directory.
  
  By  default the [1mrecogbase[0m package is not automatically loaded by [1mGAP[0m when it
  is  installed.  You  must  load  the  package with [22m[32mLoadPackage("recogbase");[0m
  before its functions become available.
  
  Usually,  this  package  is  only  usable  if  you  also  install  the [1mrecog[0m
  containing  all  the  implemented  recognition methods. Since the [1mrecog[0m then
  automatically  loads  the  [1mrecogbase[0m the only has to load both packages with
  [22m[32mLoadPackage("recog");[0m.
  
  Please,  send  us an e-mail if you have any questions, remarks, suggestions,
  etc.  concerning this package. Also, I would like to hear about applications
  of this package.
