Remember a projective method to check whether it is the trivial group!
Make sure that projective leaf nodes do report "Size" correctly!
Do more tests before embarking into Tensor?


TensorInduced:

 - assume: low index already ran
   if the action on one tensor factor has a small degree permrep, then
   low index might have found r* this one.

 - Look at dimension to guess r
 - Let l := LCM(Exponents of primitive groups on r points)
 - Create random elements in G, power up with l
 - Take Fast Normal closure
 - check reducibility, clifford gives permrep or tensor
 - otherwise hope that this is tensor decomposable and our method is
   applicable
 - check whether tensor decomp is respected by the entire group.
